## Horiseon

# HW 1

For this assignment we will add accessibility to the website's sourcecode.

This requires us to change ambiguous HTML elements into more readable and understandable elements.
The majority of the changes done are changing the div elements to a more descriptive HTML element type such as main, nav, section, etc..

This refactoring of the sourcecode makes no visible changes on the website itself when viewed in the browser but when viewing the sourcecode itself makies it much easier to navigate for anyone trying to find particular sections and items within the webpage which inturn allows for easier editing and addition of any new content or features.

One change in our sourcecode that does change a usable user feature on the webpage is a broken link in the nav was corrected so that instead of not redirecting to a part of the webpage it is titled after, it now redirects to that section using an href following an id tag. Now all links in the nav should function as requested.

Images also were given alt text in the event that the image files are not loaded.

The website title was changed to Horiseon to match the main title of the webpage for search engine optimization.

This summarizes most of the changes completed for this assignment.
